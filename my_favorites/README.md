# my_favorites

A sample Flutter project to learn app state management explained in the following tutorial :

- [Simple App State Management](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The app has three screens :
1. Login 
    - User enters his/her name and the user is greeted with toast message based on if the user is new visitor
    or an existing one. User's favorites list is loaded accordingly.
2. Items List
    - List of random items user can set as favorites and the favorited items can also be removed for each user.
3. Favorites List
    - List of favorites items for the user.

The app state maintains the logged in user and his/her favorite items list.
